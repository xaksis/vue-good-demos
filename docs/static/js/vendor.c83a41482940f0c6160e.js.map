to an instance of Date.\n *\n * If the argument is an instance of Date, the function returns its clone.\n *\n * If the argument is a number, it is treated as a timestamp.\n *\n * If an argument is a string, the function tries to parse it.\n * Function accepts complete ISO 8601 formats as well as partial implementations.\n * ISO 8601: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\n *\n * If the argument is null, it is treated as an invalid date.\n *\n * If all above fails, the function passes the given argument to Date constructor.\n *\n * **Note**: *all* Date arguments passed to any *date-fns* function is processed by `toDate`.\n * All *date-fns* functions will throw `RangeError` if `options.additionalDigits` is not 0, 1, 2 or undefined.\n *\n * @param {*} argument - the value to convert\n * @param {Options} [options] - the object with options.
